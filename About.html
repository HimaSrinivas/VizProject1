    <p>The Broad Street cholera outbreak (or Golden Square outbreak) was a severe outbreak of cholera that occurred in 1854 near Broad Street (now Broadwick Street) in the Soho district of the City of Westminster, London, England, and occurred during the 1846–1860 cholera pandemic happening worldwide. This outbreak, which killed 616 people, is best known for the physician John Snow's study of its causes and his hypothesis that germ-contaminated water was the source of cholera, rather than particles in the air (referred to as "miasmata").[1][2] This discovery came to influence public health and the construction of improved sanitation facilities beginning in the mid-19th century. Later, the term "focus of infection" started to be used to describe sites, such as the Broad Street pump, in which conditions are good for transmission of an infection. Snow's endeavor to find the cause of the transmission of cholera caused him to unknowingly create a double-blind experiment.</p>
    <p>In the fall of 1854, 500 people died in just 10 days in the center of London in the worst of a series of cholera outbreaks. At the time, the way that cholera spread was a mystery, generally attributed to miasma, or bad air. Dr. John Snow, however, had a different theory: the drinking water was killing people.</p>
    <p>In the 19th century, drinking water was provided to residents by several competing water companies who operated public pumps in water districts around the city. Most of these companies pumped their water directly out of the polluted Thames River.

        London had suffered a series of debilitating cholera outbreaks before the 1853 outbreak, including serious outbreaks in 1832 and the worst outbreak which killed some 14,137 residents in 1849. That year Snow published his first paper outlining his theory of water-borne disease. In 1854 he got the chance to test his theory.</p>

    <h3>Inferences</h3>
   Some insights about the epidemic
    <p>1.) Maximum number of deaths occured on September 1st with number of deaths equal to 143.
    <p>2.) Followed by 116 deaths on September 2nd which is 2nd highest number of deaths per day
    <p>3.) The age group with highest number of deaths is group >80.
    <p>4.) The age group with 2nd highest number of deaths is group 0-10</p>
    <p>5.) This indicates that Old age and young age people are more prone to death by cholera. 
    <p>6.) Deaths near the workhouse and brewery are comparitively lower .
    <p>7.) Workhouse had a well of its own which might have lead to fewer deaths around as less people would drink water from the pump.
    <p>8.) There were given free beers deaths to the workers who worked in brewery, that means drinking less water from affected pumps which might be the reason for fewer deaths near brewery area.
